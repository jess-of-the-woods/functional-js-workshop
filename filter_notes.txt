Basic Filter Notes

Array: messages
messages has message keys.. so is accessible with .message
# Task

Use Array#filter to write a function called getShortMessages.

getShortMessages takes an array of objects with '.message' properties and returns an array of messages that are less than < 50 characters long.

The function should return an array containing the messages themselves, without their containing object.

## Arguments

  * messages: an Array of 10 to 100 random objects that look something like this:

    {
      message: 'Esse id amet quis eu esse aute officia ipsum.' // random
    }

## Conditions

  * Do not use any for/while loops or Array#forEach.
  * Do not create any unnecessary functions e.g. helpers.

## Hint

  * Try chaining some Array methods!

## Example

    [ 'Tempor quis esse consequat sunt ea eiusmod.',
      'Id culpa ad proident ad nulla laborum incididunt.',
      'Ullamco in ea et ad anim anim ullamco est.',
      'Est ut irure irure nisi.' ]

did you want messages ​less than​ 50 or ​greater than​ 50?


doesn't this way filter out messages larger than 50? that is what I am wanting to do. I have tried it both ways.. '>' & '<', both fail to pass

well the name of your function is getShortMessages so I'm assuming you want the short ones. a 'return true' will include the element in the array, a 'return false' will exclude it. So for a short message, < 50 will be what you want. Note that you should test val.message.length, not val.message

filter keeps elements if the callback returns true. It's not "filtering out", if that makes sense. "filtering in", I suppose.
